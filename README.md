Kurosawa Project

<details> <summary><b>Disclaimer</b> (Technical Assignment for InfinityGames)</summary>

Why Kurosawa? I've been binge watching all of Akira Kurosawa filmography and Rashomon was fresh on my mind when I got this as an technical assignment. Great movie.

I'll be honest it was really fun and I'll port this to WebGL and keep developing it for a while. First-ish game of 2026! I will also keep this repository public as I believe it represents the general quality of my code when in a rush or a short deadline.

## Short Intro

This project aims to follow a loose (given the time constraints) MVP architecture for parts where was needed. All code is supposed to be easily readable and tries to be non-technical Designer friendly.

The original game is a relaxing 2D puzzle and while that was the assignment, I could not hold myself and give it a change of theme. I tried to keep it somewhat relaxing, at least not stress inducing, while converting it into 3D.

I've been getting more into Technical Art in these last months so I also took this as an opportunity to train my creative muscle and took the personal challenge to create at least a couple shaders and model the 3D assets.


# Author's Opinion and Future Improvements

<details> <summary>Cheats</summary>

I did not play test all of the levels. If you get stuck on any of them(I believe the 4th one is currently impossible) you can find a Cheat 🅱️utton . It will finish this level. It's ok.

<details> <summary>Planning and Timing</summary>

I started this project by playing the OG game and planning my week accordingly. Finding art, audio and modeling the 3D assets always takes time and I tried to plan ahead of that and I believe I did it fairly well if I may say so.

<details> <summary>Shaders</summary>

I could have gone a little more wild with the shaders but I planned for an infinite startfield along a water surface (like Starry Nights from Van Gogh but with way more stars) with an orthographic 2.5D view.

Did I manage to achieve what I was planning? Kind of. In the end it looked more like Interstellar.

<details> <summary>3D Assets</summary>

I also could have risked a lil more with the 3D assets. In the end the lighting was not looking exactly how I wanted it to look and I was not going to spend my precious time tweaking Light values. I also could easily increased the tri count in every asset. I was trying to not waste too much time on other stuff that was not coding and planning in general.

<details> <summary>VFX</summary>

They are really ugly. I ended up using a random Toon VFX I bought in a random Unity sale ages ago. I like making my own as I usually do, but hey—time constraints.

<details> <summary>AI Usage</summary>

I'm not shy at using the tools that are at my disposable however I dislike having it taking my decisions away. I plan my whole architecture, code and iterate on it.
AI tools should be used as boilerplate speed up, it should not take my decision and agency on MY code. They are amazing for repetitive work and they can speed project setup so much. However, I like code and makings games.
